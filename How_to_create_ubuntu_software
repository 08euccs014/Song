firstly i search for how to create ubuntu desktop application, but then got nothing much other than Qt GTK ide and i will not work for me.

Then if found an another solution called "quickly", you can install it using ubuntu software center or simply usign cli.

basically this works in python, so you need to learn it and gtk library to use the ui.

after isntallation to just create app type the following command:
quickly create ubuntu-application myfirstapp

it will create an application you can goto it's folder 
cd myfirstapp

then you can also run it usign following command
quickly run

then to desing ui, 
quickly design
or 
quickly glad 

then you can also edit the source code to chagne functionaning ,
quickly edit

there is main file which has window named in it's filename eg. MyfirstappWindow.py
you need to open and start the code :)

for using gtk library you can use following link that i found doing some googling "gtk tutorial linux python"
http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/entry.html

then you can also follow the following tutorial for this
